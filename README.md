# Disaster-Management-udacity

This Project is part of Data Science Nanodegree Program by Udacity in collaboration with Figure Eight. The dataset contains pre-labelled tweet and messages from real-life disaster events. The project aim is to build a Natural Language Processing (NLP) model to categorize messages on a real time basis.

This project is divided in the following key sections:

Processing data, building an ETL pipeline to extract data from source, clean the data and save them in a SQLite DB
Build a machine learning pipeline to train the which can classify text message in various categories
Run a web app which can show model results in real time
